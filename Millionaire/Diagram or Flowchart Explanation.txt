Start/Stop Nodes:

Represented by start and stop.
These nodes mark the beginning and end of the activity diagram.
Output: A filled circle for start and a filled circle with a border for stop.
Activities:

Represented by :Activity Name;.
These rectangles with rounded corners denote a specific action or process step.
Example: :Initialize Game;, :Display Question;.
Output: A rounded rectangle with the text inside.
Decision Nodes:

Represented by if (Condition) then (yes) ... else (no) ... endif.
These diamonds represent decision points in the flow where the path splits based on a condition.
Example: if (userAnswer == "l") then (yes) ... else (no).
Output: A diamond shape with the condition text inside. The "yes" and "no" paths branch out from the diamond.
Loops:

Represented by while (Condition) ... endwhile.
These structures indicate a loop that continues based on a condition.
Example: while (!isGameOver) ... endwhile.
Output: A loop structure where the flow returns to the starting point of the loop condition.
Overall Output:
Flow: The diagram visually represents the sequence of actions (activities) and decision points (conditions) in the game flow.
Initialization: The game initializes and welcomes the player.
Main Loop: Continuously displays questions and processes user inputs until the game is over.
Lifeline Handling: Handles the use of lifelines if the user chooses to use one.
Quit Handling: Ends the game if the user chooses to quit.
Answer Checking: Validates the user's answer and updates the game state accordingly.
Correct Answer: Updates prize and proceeds to the next question or ends the game if it was the last question.
Incorrect Answer: Ends the game and displays the final prize.
Visual Representation:
The diagram starts at the start node.
It proceeds through the initialization and welcome activities.
Enters a loop where it displays questions, reads user input, and processes the input based on conditions.
Uses decision nodes to handle different branches for lifelines, quitting, and checking answers.
Ends at the stop node after the game concludes.
